This is a simple space invaders clone made using python and the pygame library.

The modules used within this project are as follows:
> sys
> pygame
> pygame.sprites
> pygame.font
> time
> json

This project was inspired from the project in "Python Crash Course 2nd Edition" by Eric Matthes with some alterations.
I plan to implement more features and improvements over time.
